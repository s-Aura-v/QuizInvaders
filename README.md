### Abstract
QuizInvaders is a space-invader-escque matching game where you match two terms together. 

### Purpose 
Gamification is a popular concept that helps connect students to educational facts through their love of games. QuizInvaders is inspired by Space Invaders, a popular 1970s arcade game, and Quizlet. Currently, I am taking Spanish 101 as required by my language requirements at SUNY Oswego, so I thought this would be a great way to inspire myself to memorize vocabulary.
